Help the rich stay rich. Keep you grateful and controlled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Waiting for permission, a handout, and the golden people to let you in perpetuates the idea that someone should be allowed to control access to creativity and entrepreneurship. That kind of thing serves the corporations and the curators pretty well. It lets them keep playing a massive part in the supply chain. It allows them to keep owning what we consume and when we consume it. It lets them hold the narrative. It enables them to own everything. It lets them own you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s the alternative? Go indie. Stay indie. Don&rsquo;t give in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t see a reason to wait for permission.

Now, you&rsquo;re allowed to make what you want to make. Now, you&rsquo;re allowed to be who you are inside.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;We spend so much time waiting for permission because it&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve been trained to do. We look for the gatekeeper when we want to start something new or live out our truth.

She&rsquo;s created a cult following of millions of people, harnessing the power of parasociality to sell countless records and tickets. Anyone that writes about Taylor includes several references to her lyrics, and probably some allusions to her personal life too, leaving easter eggs mirroring Taylor&rsquo;s own love of callbacks. Her music&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;modern folklore, not just for her way with storytelling, but for its ubiquity, permeating every facet of pop culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last October, Taylor Swift released her re-recorded version of&nbsp;<em>1989</em>, still her most popular album to date. It&rsquo;s still a great, if exceptionally frontloaded album, but one nearly impossible to recreate.<em>&nbsp;1989&nbsp;</em>superproducer Max Martin isn&rsquo;t on board, so it&rsquo;s up to her long-time engineer Christopher Rowe to craft soundalikes.

(15, 'What we do on the data science team', '<p>Data science stands at the heart of Agoda&rsquo;s operational strategy, transforming complex data into actionable insights. It&rsquo;s a key player in our pursuit of technological advancement and business efficiency. In this blog, our data science manager, Aviel Makmal, shares insights into his role as a data science manager.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Roles and Responsibilities</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>My journey at Agoda began five years ago as a data scientist. With time, my role evolved into leading the data science fraud teams. Today, my responsibilities involve managing the anomaly detection team, customer-facing LLM, internal LLM initiatives, and spearheading pilot projects in areas like Marketing and payment optimization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I consider my role as a data science manager to be my true calling as it aligns perfectly with my interests &mdash; being data-driven, solving complex problems, ideation, and communication. Seeing the real-world impact of our work in the company is rewarding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My days are dynamic, filled with strategy meetings, interviews (<a href=\"https://careersatagoda.com/vacancies/?teams=&amp;locations=&amp;search=data+science&amp;page=1\" target=\"_blank\">we are hiring!</a>), and aligning with my team to ensure our goals are met. I also dedicate time to hands-on tasks, from data analysis to prototyping models for upcoming projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of our key projects was developing an internal RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Chatbot. This tool has been a game-changer in providing technical support across Agoda, allowing our IT teams to focus on more complex challenges while delivering prompt responses to their issues. Though the project is internal facing, the impact is quite significant.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Navigating Challenges</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>With the introduction of GenAI, LLM, and RAG, we ventured into relatively uncharted territories. Our challenge was to figure out the best way to scale in the right direction, measure the quality of LLM-generated answers, and how to improve the overall accuracy of the bot. As there wasn&rsquo;t any streamlined gold standard approach yet, we had to iterate and go back to the drawing board quite often till we found the right way. Since then, we have scaled much faster, understood our pitfalls, and iterated between different solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to remain flexible when initiatives don&rsquo;t go as planned. Sometimes, you can fall in love with your idea and your way of thinking, but the reality/data shows different results. It is good to let go of ideas if the data doesn&rsquo;t support them and consult with others.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>My day-to-day stack is Python and pyspark/SQL and their corresponding libraries. However, the introduction of Co-Pilot and ChatGPT has been transformative, helping me brainstorm ideas and write code more efficiently. These tools have been helpful when working on different projects as they enhance productivity. I encourage every data scientist or developer to use these technologies daily.</p>\r\n', 'assets/upload/blogimg/Screenshot_(6).png', 1, '2024-01-11 02:27:14', '2024-01-11 06:41:01', '#DataScience #Technology #Engi', 21);
